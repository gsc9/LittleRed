Little Red Crossbow Slinger
=========

Simple 2-level game based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood, using JGame open source code.



Genre: Non-Shooting Scroller (first level), Fighting Game (second level)

Goal: To avoid the flowers flying about in the air as you make your way to your grandmother's house, and then to defeat the wolf in a shootout.

Different levels: First level: You are Little Red Riding Hood, taking the path in the woods to take your grandmother a basket of goodies. Avoid the flowers blowing in the wind as you go along; after hitting four of those flowers, you will not be able to resist stopping and picking them!
Second level: You've made it past the treacherous floaty flowers. But what's that coming from the direction of your grandmother's house? A wolf! You whip out your crossbow pistol, just as he whips out the hunting rifle that he obtained from an unfortunate hunter. Engage in a shootout with the wolf with your remaining lives; if you defeat him, you will be able to rescue your grandmother and the hunter. If he defeats you...well, you probably have some idea of where you will end up.

Basic Mechanics: Left and right arrows to dodge flowers, as well as 'z' to shoot arrows when fighting the wolf. (Shooting is disabled during the first level, but enabled during the second.)

Perks: Home-baked graphics, some of which move!
